# Hi, I'm Mariela 👋

I'm a systems-oriented professional with a background in **IT operations, business analysis, and product-focused software projects**.

I enjoy translating **real operational problems** into structured systems, focusing on:
- clarity over complexity
- usability over features
- documentation and functional design as first-class citizens

My recent work centers on **portfolio projects** that simulate real business scenarios rather than academic exercises.

I prioritize:
