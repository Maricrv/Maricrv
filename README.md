# Hi, I'm Mariela

I work at the intersection of operations, systems, and technology, with a strong focus on reducing operational friction through well-structured processes and practical solutions.

I’m especially interested in environments where:
- processes are complex or poorly documented
- people rely heavily on manual coordination (emails, calls, spreadsheets)
- technology can genuinely improve clarity and efficiency

---

## What I focus on

- Understanding real operational problems
- Translating workflows into structured systems
- Defining functional requirements and validating solutions
- Using technology (systems, automation, AI tools) as a means to improve operations

## How I work

- I value clarity, usability, and documentation
- I avoid over-engineering when simpler solutions work better

I’m interested in roles related to operations, business analysis, and system-oriented problem solving.
